# Start the testing postgresql server, setting the actual unix user to be the
# PostgreSQL admin.  The $PGHOST/$PGPORT are set appropriately, so psql is able
# to run without passwords.  This also sets shell exit trap callback so that if
# something goes wrong and package build fails, the temporary database is
# automatically cleaned up.
